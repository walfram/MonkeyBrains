/**
 * Separation steering behavior gives a character the ability to maintain a
 * certain separation distance from others nearby. This can be used to prevent
 * characters from crowding together. <br><br>

 For each nearby character, a repulsive force is computed by subtracting the
 positions of our character and the nearby character, normalizing, and then
 applying a 1/r weighting. (That is, the position vectorTo vector is scaled by
 1/r^2.)". "These repulsive forces for each nearby character are summed
 together to produce the overall steering force. <br><br>
 *
 * The supplied neighbours should only be the nearby neighbours in the field of
 * view of the character that is steering. It is good to ignore anything behind
 * the character."
