/**
 * Returns a steering force to avoid a given obstacle. The purely lateral
 * steering force will turn our vehicle towards a silhouette edge of the
 * obstacle. Avoidance is required when (1) the obstacle intersects the
 * vehicle's current path, (2) it is in front of the vehicle, and (3) is within
 * minTimeToCollision seconds of travel at the vehicle's current velocity.
 * Returns a zero vector value when no avoidance is required. <br> <br>
 *
 * The implementation of obstacle avoidance behavior here will make a
 * simplifying assumption that both the character and obstacle can be reasonably
 * approximated as spheres. <br> <br>
 *
 * Keep in mind that this relates to obstacle avoidance not necessarily to
 * collision detection. <br> <br>
 *
 * The goal of the behavior is to keep an imaginary cylinder of free space in
 * front of the character. The cylinder lies along the character's forward axis,
 * has a diameter equal to the character's bounding sphere, and extends from the
 * character's center for a distance based on the character's velocity. <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * It is needed that the obstacles (Agents) have the "radius" atribute correctly
 * setted up.
