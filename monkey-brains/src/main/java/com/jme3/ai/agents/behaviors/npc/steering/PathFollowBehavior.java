/**
 * "Path following behavior enables a character to steer along a predetermined
 * path, such as a roadway, corridor or tunnel. This is distinct from
 * constraining a vehicle rigidly to a path like a train rolling along a track.
 * Rather path following behavior is intended to produce motion such as people
 * moving down a corridor: the individual paths remain near, and often parallel
 * to, the centerline of the corridor, but are free to deviate from it. In the
 * implementation described here, a path will be idealized as a spine and a
 * radius. The spine" is represented as a "poly-line (a series of connected line
 * segments). The path is then a tube or generalized cylinder: a circle of the
 * specified radius, swept along the specified spine. The goal of the path
 * following steering behavior is to move a character along the path while
 * taying within the specified radius of the spine. If the character is
 * initially far away from the path, it must first approach, then follow the
 * path."
 * <br><br>
 *
 * "To compute steering for path following, a velocity-based prediction is made
 * of the character's future position. The predicted future position is
 * projected onto the nearest point on the path spine. If this projection
 * distance (from the predicted position to the nearest on-path point) is less
 * than the path radius, then the character is deemed to be correctly following
 * the path and no corrective steering is required. Otherwise the character is
 * veering away from the path, or is too far away from the path. To steer back
 * towards the path, the seek behavior is used to steer towards the on-path
 * projection of the predicted future position. A null or zero value is returned
 * if no corrective steering is required." <br><br>
 *
 * If you need the agent to pass exactly from the beginning of the first spine
 * you must use seek before activating path follow.
